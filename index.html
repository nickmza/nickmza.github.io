  <p>In his article ‘<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agile-does-work-oleg-vishnepolsky?trk=hp-feed-article-title-like">Agile Does Not Work</a>’ Oleg Vishnepolsky makes several observations based on his experiences with Agile development (note the big ‘A’, it’s my emphasis, not his). Specifically, he cites issues with quality, predictability, poor strategic alignment, monolithic architecture due to poor design, complex and costing infrastructure and challenges managing stakeholders.</p>
<p>A response frequently heard to such accusations is that “If Agile is not working for you then you are not doing it right”. This response is the last defence of an Agile consultant or coach that has nothing left to offer. Sadly, In many cases this is all many coaches have to offer in the first place.</p>
<p>Oleg is quite correct when he talks about the lack of understanding of the principles underpinning agile development and the hordes of consultants trying to make a quick buck packaging principles and techniques as dogma and selling them wholesale. How can he not be when anyone could be proclaimed a Scrum MASTER after attending a  trivial 2-day training course?</p>
<p>Sadly. what Oleg is describing will ring true for many teams that have attempted to go Agile. I have heard the same criticisms from many teams and the conclusion is always the same: We tried Agile and it did not work for us.</p>
<p>When teams go Agile and it fails they are left in a difficult situation. The populist view is that Waterfall &#x3D; Bad and Agile &#x3D; Good. To say otherwise would be heresy and result in hordes of Agilistas storming your team area with pitchforks and sticky notes! But, if Agile failed for you then what? Most teams end up where Oleg seems to have landed – “Common Sense Development” or just “Built it till it works”.</p>
<p>The tragedy here is that the (agile) baby has been thrown out with the (Agile) bathwater. Whilst there may still be value for the team in agile principles and techniques the team are now totally switched off to the notion and are left to fend for themselves. They now have to re-discover many of the lessons that have already been learned in the broader agile community.  </p>
<p>Ultimately they will learn that “Common Sense development” is actually just agile development.</p>
<p>If your team is struggling with the issues listed above or if your experience of applying agile is more of religious, dogmatic exercise heavily reliant on faith and light on results then you have more than likely been sold Agile with a big A. Agile is the dogmatic, fast food, saccharin flavour of agile concocted by the consultants and peddled to the masses. It does not work and will add little value. As Oleg will attest.</p>
<p>So where to from here?</p>
<p>Let’s start by sticking a large pin that overinflated A and get Agile back to plan old agile. Let’s stop doing things because someone told us that if we don’t we are not Agile. Rather let’s start doing things because they add value, because they make sense and because they help the team move faster.</p>
<p>Look at what you are doing in the name of ‘being Agile’ and ask yourself and your team the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we know why we are doing this and the value it should add?</li>
<li>Is what we are doing adding the expected value?</li>
<li>If we stopped doing this would anyone notice or care?</li>
<li>Did we learn something from this activity that changed what we originally planned to do or thought?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answered NO to more than a couple of these, you should really re-evaluate whether you need it. Start by looking at why you are doing something and the value you expect to extract. Agile will fill your days with arcane rituals that add little value. Use common sense here – do more of the things that add value and less of things that don’t.</p>
<p>There are some specific pitfalls that result in the issues that Oleg identified I’ll address each of these in an upcoming post.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
       
  <p>The other day I read an article by Ian Sommerville describing his experiences with Test Driven Development (TDD) and his ultimate conclusion that TDD is fundamentally flawed. Robert Martin quickly posted an excellent response pointing out that what Sommerville was experiencing was typical of people new to Test Driven Development. Whilst Martin’s response pulls no punches in pointing out the source of Sommerville’s issues it does not really leave any practical advice for someone struggling with learning TDD. </p>
<p>Sommerville’s article struck a chord with me because what he was describing was so similar to my own experiences whilst learning TDD. Brittle tests and the feeling that somehow I was perverting the code in order to pass a test haunted me to the point that I nearly came to same conclusion as Sommerville. Ultimately though these issues were, as Martin points out, symptoms of being an amateur. I kept going and many, many tests later have got to the point where I am comfortable with TDD.</p>
<p>My advice for someone struggling with TDD would be as follows:</p>
<h2 id="Take-Smaller-Steps"><a href="#Take-Smaller-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Take Smaller Steps"></a>Take Smaller Steps</h2><p>Sommerville describes TDD as follows: “Test-first or test-driven driven development (TDD) is an approach to software development where you write the tests before you write the program”. This is not an accurate description of TDD. Many developers reading this will conclude that you need to write the whole test first, before you write any production code. This simple misunderstanding of the process of TDD is at the core of many of the issues people have with TDD. </p>
<p>When you write the whole test first you are robbing yourself of the ability to learn from the process of TDD. The key phrase here is Test DRIVEN. The Tests DRIVE the development. If you write the whole test first you are making a number of untested assumptions about how the code will play out and then forcing the production code to fit in with those assumptions. This leads to many of the issues that Sommerville describes.</p>
<h2 id="You-need-to-take-smaller-steps"><a href="#You-need-to-take-smaller-steps" class="headerlink" title="You need to take smaller steps."></a>You need to take smaller steps.</h2><p>Try this: Write enough test code to fail the test (and a compilation error is a failing test). Write enough production code to make the test pass or clear the compilation error. Refactor the code you have just written and repeat the process until the unit test passes completely. For a short description read The Three Rules of TDD. For a detailed one read Kent Beck’s TDD By Example.</p>
<p>Many developers balk at this process. It feels unnatural. Which, if you have been happily coding for years, it would be. You would not always apply TDD like this but for learning TDD it really helps ingrain the cadence and cognitive processes involved. What I find is that the more uncertain I am of the design the smaller the increment I work in - almost down to a 1:1 ratio of test to production code. As the design emerges and I become more confident I move in larger steps. But never straying from the basic pattern. All production code is written in the service of passing a test. This ensures that I only write code I need. </p>
<p>When I find people struggling with tests it is often because they have broken out of the pattern and are implementing reams of production code. The impact of this on the TDD process is that by the time you return to the test the production code may be completed. You then need to retrofit the test to match your production code. At this point the Test is not Driving the development it is a Passenger. Tests written in this fashion are typically brittle and the number of tests written for a piece of functionality is generally less. </p>
<h2 id="Get-a-Coach"><a href="#Get-a-Coach" class="headerlink" title="Get a Coach"></a>Get a Coach</h2><p>Becoming proficient at TDD is not easy. It is a skill and, as with all skills, it takes time and effort to master. This is where I think many developers, especially experienced ones, go wrong. They expect to pick up TDD after reading a couple of articles and looking at some example tests. Their initial enthusiasm is soon extinguished by the frustrations of learning TDD and ultimately they give up all together. </p>
<p>It makes a huge difference to have someone who has done this before helping you. To point out alternatives or show you how to make the design more testable. It also helps to keep the enthusiasm up. If everyone in the team is new to TDD it is easy for any frustrations to boil over into defeatism. </p>
<h2 id="Practice-Practice-Practice"><a href="#Practice-Practice-Practice" class="headerlink" title="Practice, Practice, Practice"></a>Practice, Practice, Practice</h2><p>Trying to apply TDD for the first time to your current or new project at work is difficult. There are all sorts of other factors that complicate the process - time, budget and legacy code all conspire against the application of TDD. I often here this: “We started with TDD but it was taking so long our project manager said that we don’t have time for it.”. </p>
<p>My suggestion is to become proficient at the basic process of TDD before trying to apply it to a real-world scenario. There are hundreds of practice examples, also called Katas, for TDD. If you can’t do a basic kata such as String Calculator then you are not ready to start applying this at work. </p>
<p>Another great way to learn is at code camps and hackathons. Here you will be exposed to different views and approaches to TDD in a fun and open environment. It’s a great way to confirm and extend your own views.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The response to novice frustrations sometimes tends to ‘If it is not working then you are not doing it right’. This is not constructive and, in the absence of any constructive advice, can be construed as zealotry. I’ve outlined here some of the things that helped me with TDD and hope it will help you as well.</p>
