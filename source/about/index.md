# About this blog
This blog was created using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) with the [Ayer](https://github.com/Shen-Yu/hexo-theme-ayer) template. It's hosted using GitHub Pages. 

I started with this list of requirements:
- No database. I'm too old to have a pet database.
- Git-based. Version control.
- Portable. I want to be able to move to another platform or self-host. 
- Uses Markdown. 
- Minimal Admin. A quick glance at my timeline will show you how sporadically I post. I do not want to spend more time on admin than I do writing.

I looked at a bunch of tools including Jeckyl and Gastby and whilst they both seemed very capable they also felt like overkill for someone who can go for years without posting.
