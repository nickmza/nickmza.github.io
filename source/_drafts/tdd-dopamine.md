    TDD - Triggering Dopamine Development

The other morning I attended an excellent talk by [Andrew Richardson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-richardson-b3586819/) on the importance of having small goals. One of the points Andrew made was that completing a task, however small,  triggers a hit of Dopamine - the neurotransmitter associated with feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. The way Andrew described the feedback loop involved reminded me  of Test-Driven Development (TDD). This got me thinking - maybe this is why I like it so much?
 
TDD has been my go-to development style for nearly 10 years now. This was not always the case though. Previously I flirted with it but never really found compelling value. It wasn’t until I attended a TDD Bootcamp that the light really came on and since then I haven’t turned back. 
 
If you ask me about why I like TDD so much here are some of the answers I would give:
 
A feeling of constant progress. TDD lets me feel like I'm always moving forward. The cycle of Red-Green-Refactor keeps me focused and every time a new test passes I feel like I’m getting somewhere.
 
Confidence Building. TDD allows be to try things and if they don’t work out quickly rollback to a working state. This gives me the confidence to try new things. If I see a potential refactor I can make it and get fast feedback about any side-effects. 
 
Faster ‘Inner Loop’.  For me TDD makes my Inner Loop faster because I spend negligible time in the debugger. When I do find myself in the debugger my overwhelming sense is that I have made a mistake in my design. Watching developers spin up a test environment (taking minutes) to then hit a break-point, look at some values, change a line of code and the do it again is painful to watch.

> The ‘Inner Loop’ is "The iterative process of writing, building and debugging code that a single developer performs before sharing the code, either publicly or with their team.".
 
Leaves a Rough Edge. In pottery 'leaving a rough edge' means to leave a piece of obviously unfinished work so that you can get back to the flow of creating quickly. If I need to stop coding I will leave a failing test as a 'rough edge'. When I come back I start the failing test provides an obvious starting point. I also create stubs of failing tests as I go reminding me to cover edge cases. This means I have an executable task list. When all the ‘tasks’ are green then I am done. 
 
Documentation. I'm not a big fan of traditional documentation in the form of Confluence, Word Docs or Code Comments. As Ron Jeffries says "Code never lies, comments sometimes do". TDD creates executable documentation that explains the intended behavior of the code. This helps developers who come after (in many cases 'future me') to understand what I was trying to do. 
 
I think that all of the above are good enough reasons for me to keep doing TDD. I like Andrew’s reason better though. TDD is me hacking the Dopamine reward system in my brain to make me a happier engineer.
