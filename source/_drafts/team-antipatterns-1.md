## Team too big
When teams are too large the amount of communication and coordination increases. There is also an expectation that with such a large team they should be able to get lots done. This is often not the case as the communication and coordination overhead conspire to erode any potential productivity gains. 

It's also common that large teams are a consequence of combining multiple responsibilities. The resulting increase in cognitive load further impacts any expected productivity gains as not every person in the team will have the same capabilities.

One twist on this anti-pattern is a large team with a bottleneck around a specific discipline. The classic example here being the QA role. In this scenario a large pool of engineers are creating features which then pile up because the sole QA cannot test them fast enough. 

## Team too small
Small teams can work so long as you manage the Cognitive Load and demand. A small team with high cognitive load will negatively impact the people. If this is combined with poor capacity management the results are predictably disastrous.

## Too much cognitive load
Regardless of team size too much cognitive load invariably results in knowledge silos in the team, burnout and frustration.

## Too little cognitive load
Under-stimulated teams typically suffer from high attrition as people flee the team before it turns into a career dead-end. For those that remain there is stagnation. The lack of challenge in the domain means that new skills are not needed and there is no drive. To be clear - this is an indictment of the organisation that created this situation, not of the people stuck in such teams.

## Overloaded Team Types
Once I read Team Topologies I realised that many of our challenges occur when we have Teams that operate as a combination of more than one of the fundamental team types. For example a 'Stream-Aligned' team that managed multiple streams. Another is a team that was both 'Stream-Aligned' and a 'Platform'. It was 'Stream-aligned' in that it had a sponsor and a set of objectives but also a 'Platform' in that it was expected to provide a set of services to other teams.

Regardless of the combination where a single team is operating in this manner the impact is poor prioritisation, poor encapsulation, slow page of development, duplication of effort and blurred boundaries.

## Mixed Interaction Models
My challenge here was that in many cases were/are relying on a single communication style - Collaboration. This results in huge amounts of communication and effort to get anything done. At a minimum we need 3 teams to get anything of substance done. When they are all relying on Collaboration it is an expensive and suprisingly fragile process. Another consequence of this is that teams bleed implementation detail to the extent that teams know a lot of detail about what each is doing.

# Where to from here?

If any of this sounds familiar you may be wondering what can be done.

Firstly, recognise which of the team types are in play. Then agree on the interaction model for interactions between them.

At this point you have a template for where you want to be. Now you need to think about how you can get there. The key is to make small changes - testing as you go to ensure that you are getting the right results.

Start by looking for the antipatterns above and use this to guide your decisions. Ask yourself:
-  Which teams are too large and could be split? 
-  Could multiple small teams be merged? 
-  Would moving responsibilities between teams help balance cognitive load?
