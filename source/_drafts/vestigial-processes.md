In biology Vestigial Organs "are rudimentary anatomical structures that are retained in a species despite having lost their primary ancestral function". In agile we uncover 'Vestigial Activities' - things that teams do whose original purpose has been lost or forgotten.

Often steps are added to a process in response to a specific event or need. These can come up organically as part of the team's retro process and as a response to a specific event. In the short term these steps add value but after a while they become 'part of the furniture', something the team has always done. Over time as people come and go the reasons for the step being added are forgotten as well as the specific problem being solved. If the activity is still quietly adding value this is well and good - but in many cases they could be actively impeding the team. 

A pernicious form of this is when there are attempts to 'standardise' processes across teams in large organisations. This is generally done with good intentions but what can happen is that a bunch of Vestigial Activies are then baked into the process. The original intent is further obscured and teams will be less inclined to challenge the dogma of an 'official' process.

So what's to be done?

Teams must own their process. I'm all for having organisational standards, principles and guidelines but at the end of the day the experiences and needs of a team are unique. Mandating a one-size-fits-all approach negates this reality. 

Owning their process means more than just being able to add and remove steps as they seem fit. It means actively interrogating each step, identifying bottlenecks and striving to improve the overall process.

When steps are added or removed from a team's process there should be a specific hypotheses associated with it and a time-box set. For example, "By moving step X to before step Y we expect an increase in Velocity and a decrease in rework.. We will run this experiment for the next 2 sprints and then review".
